Backbase Training Exercise

CXP Mobile SDK - Module 3a: Mobile Project Development
------------------------------------------------------

### Exercise 2

*note: This exercise is 2 of 10 in a series of exercises that follow on from
each other and should not be used independently*

#### Description

In this exercise, you will learn how to organize folder structure and setup Rsync for Xcode 
and Gradle for Android Studio to sync the widgets assets into your mobile app's workspace. 
You will learn how to connect connect the Mobile Application to the server's model.

#### Steps

- In the configs-android.json and configs-ios.json change serverURL to the portal's URL. But to access the server from the emulator please use for Android emulator 10.0.2.2 for the Genymotion emulator 10.0.3.2 To access the server from the iOS emulator use localhost:

    -   "serverURL": "http://localhost:7777/portalserver", //iOS Emulator
    -   "serverURL": "http://10.0.2.2:7777/portalserver", //Android Emulator
    -   "serverURL": "http://10.0.3.2:7777/portalserver", //Genymotion Emulator

- Change the name of the portal in the configs-android.json and configs-ios.json to the name of the portal you created in CXP e.g. **lpmobile** 

- You should have your **Todo** widget added to your portal;

- Copy the contents of DemoWidgetsAssets/assets/backbase/demo-widgets/* folder to the parent folder(backbase). 
Thus we need to get rid of **demo-widgets** folder. To understand why, please compare models generated by portal <http://localhost:7777/portalserver/portals/lpmobile/mobile/model> and local DemoWidgetsAssets/assets/backbase/demo-widgets/conf/model.json file;

-   Copy statics from the portal into the assets folder
    of your mobile app.

#### iOS Platform and Rsync

-   Adjust paths for pointing to configs-ios.json in
    CXPMobile/Resources/AppDelegate.m ln83;

-   Run, it will fail to load resources;

-   We still have to deal with path changes, go to configs-ios.json and adjust paths
    to scripts or other resources;

-   Note that some scripts may not be present in your portal "features" folder,
    like launchpad-setup.js or fastclick.js, you may need to keep them outside
    of static folder:

    -   Create folder DemoWidgetsAssets/assets/backbase/libs for mobile specific
        libraries;

    -   Copy fastclick folder from
        static/com.backbase.cxp-demo/libraries/fastclick to the created
        directory;

    -   Copy launchpad/launchpad-setup.js from
        static/com.backbase.cxp-demo/libraries/launchpad/launchpad-setup.js to
        the created directory as libs/launchpad/launchpad-setup.js;

-   Then you need to setup **Rsync** for Build Phases:

    -   Select DemoWidgetsAssets bundle;

        -   Go to the **Build Phases** tab

        -   Click the **+** button, and choose **new Run Script Phase**

        -   Make sure this **Run Script Phase** is running before **Copy Bundle
            Resources** phase

        -   Add a script and and type something like

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
rsync -rtvu --delete /[path_to_your_portal]/training-cxp-portal-5.6/statics/dist/itemRoot/static/
../DemoWidgetsAssets/assets/backbase/static/
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Adjust accordingly to your setup;

-   The script should run before the "Copy bundle resources" phase;

#### Android platform and Gradle

-   Adjust paths for pointing to configs-android.json in BackbaseApplication.java ln9;

-   Run, it will fail to load resources;

-   We still have to deal with path changes, go to configs-android.json and adjust paths
    to scripts or other resources;

-   Note that some scripts may not be present in your portal "features" folder,
    like launchpad-setup.js or fastclick.js, you may need to keep them outside
    of static folder:

    -   Create folder DemoWidgetsAssets/assets/backbase/libs for mobile specific
        libraries;

    -   Copy fastclick folder from
        static/com.backbase.cxp-demo/libraries/fastclick to the created
        directory;

    -   Copy launchpad/launchpad-setup.js from
        static/com.backbase.cxp-demo/libraries/launchpad/launchpad-setup.js to
        the created directory as libs/launchpad/launchpad-setup.js;

-   Then you need to setup Gradle task to sync static resources, add these lines
    to the end of the /app/build.Gradle file:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
def staticsMobile = '../../DemoWidgetsAssets/assets/backbase/static'

def staticsPortal = '../../../training-cxp-portal-5.6/statics/dist/itemRoot/static'

task syncStatics(type: Copy){
    delete "$staticsMobile"
    from "$staticsPortal"
    into "$staticsMobile"
}

gradle.projectsEvaluated {
    syncStatics.execute();
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Most probably you need to adjust paths to the statics of your portal and mobile.

-   Run Gradle

-   Letâ€™s test how it works, for that please do fillowing:

    -   Go to the portals static collection

    -   Add some lines to the **Todo** widget

    -   Run bb-cli to import widget

    -   Check in the browser how it looks like

    -   Buid & Run your mobile project, it will sync static folder of the portal
        with the mobile statics

    -   Check the page with Todo widget in the Emulator

#### Tips

-   First time you run it probably it won't work. The log will say that
    something is wrong with the model. This is related with permissions, your
    portal must allow anonymous users to view;

-   If you need to exclude some static non-mobile resources for Android use
    Gradle command:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
exclude 'ext/react'
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


For Xcode use flag:


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
--exclude 'libs/ext/react'
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
