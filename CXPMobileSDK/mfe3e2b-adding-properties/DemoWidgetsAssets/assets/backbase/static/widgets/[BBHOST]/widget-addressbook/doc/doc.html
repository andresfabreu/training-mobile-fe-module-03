    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <img src="media/addressbook-screenshot.png" alt="Addressbook Widget" title="Addressbook Widget" />
    <br /><br />
    <p>The Launchpad Addressbook widget is a very powerful widget with a lot of functionality. Built using AngularJS for basic widget architecture, and RequireJS for asynchronous module definition, the following pieces of functionality are core to the Addressbook widget:
    <ul>
        <li>Add new contacts to your address book to send transfers too quickly and easily later on</li>
        <li>Add a multitude of details to a contact, including Name, Account number, Phone, E-mail, birthday and address</li>
        <li>Search through contacts via a real time filter</li>
        <li>Get a quick overlook of your most recent transactions involving the current contact and your default account</li>
        <li>Send a new transfer directly from the Address book, from any user account to the currently selected contact</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Functionality</h2>
    <p>Below is a detailed look at some of the Addressbooks more complex functionality:

    <h3>Validation</h3>
    <p>The amount field is required and validated before a new transfer can be made. Below is a screenshot of what an invalid transfer looks like:

    </p>

    <h3>Search</h3>
    <p>Typing part of a contacts name into the search field of the Addressbook widget will filter the contact list based on the input</p>

    <h3>Transaction history</h3>
    <p>This view, when looking at an individual contact, shows a list of recent activities that have occurred between this contact and the users default account. Below is a screenshot demonstrating this functionality:
