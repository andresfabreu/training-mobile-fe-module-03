_note: This exercise is 3 of 10 in a series of exercises that follow on from each other and should not be used independently_

#### Description

In this exercise you will enhance your app by setting up custom preferences in CXP Explorer.

#### Steps

 - In your CXP Server, open the CXP Explorer Tool, and navigate to the **Default Page** of your **lpmobile** portal
 - Manually add a preference called **icon** with a value of **IconWelcome**
 - Build & run the mobile app, the default tab should now have a nice icon

#### Tips

-   If you don't see changes reflecting in the generated json model you probably
    need to clean the eh\_cache
    <http://localhost:7777/portalserver/ps_statistics/ehcache>
    mobileModelGroupCache and mobileModelCache
