_note: This exercise is 7 of 7 in a series of exercises that follow on from each other and should not be used independently_

#### Description

In this exercise, you will style your widget using Twitter Bootstrap's CSS toolkit.

#### Steps

 - Use Twitter Bootstrap's default classes to style your widget (form input, buttons, panels, etc.)
 - Using Twitter Bootstrap, add a trash bin icon to your **Delete Todo** button
 - Make your delete buttons black, by changing the variable in the default theme
 - The todos that are done, should have a ~~strike-through~~. Todo items that are not done should be bold
 - Create a global behavior, using only CSS. When hovering over an element, a button inside it appears. Use this behavior for your **Delete Todo** buttons
