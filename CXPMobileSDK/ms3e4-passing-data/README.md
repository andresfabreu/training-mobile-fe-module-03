## CXP Mobile SDK - Module 3: Mobile Project Development

### Exercise 4

_note: This exercise is 4 of 4 in a series of exercises that follow on from each other and should not be used independently_

#### Description

In this exercise, you will learn how to pass data between webviews.

#### Steps

 - Update the demo **Welcome** widget; add an input field and a **Add Todo** button
 - When clicking the **Add Todo** button, it should fire a pubsub event (passing along the text in the input field as data), and redirect the user to the todo page
 - Also update the **Todo widget**, so that it will automatically inject the new task in the todo list whenever the event is caught
