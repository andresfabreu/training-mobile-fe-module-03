## CXP Mobile SDK - Module 3a: Mobile Project Development

### Exercise 5

_note: This exercise is 9 of 12 in a series of exercises that follow on from each other and should not be used independently_

#### Description

In this exercise, you will learn how to setup preload and retain properties on your widget, and how to implement the pub/sub event informing the SDK of the loading of a given widget.

#### Steps

 - Add a **preload** property on your login widget, to make sure it is loaded before being displayed
 - Update the code of your mobile widget to send the pub/sub event to inform the SDK when the widget is actually loaded
 - Add a **retain** property on the ICE widget in your app so that it does not have to reload every time you come back to that page
